# NoPowerShell
NoPowerShell is a tool implemented in C# which supports executing PowerShell-like commands while remaining invisible to any PowerShell logging mechanisms. This .NET Framework 2 compatible binary can be loaded in Cobalt Strike to execute commands in-memory. No `System.Management.Automation.dll` is used; only native .NET libraries. An alternative usecase for NoPowerShell is to launch it as a DLL via rundll32.exe: `rundll32 NoPowerShell.dll,main`.

This project makes it easy for everyone to extend its functionality using only a few lines of C# code. For more info, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitsadmin/nopowershell/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Latest binaries available from the [Releases](https://github.com/bitsadmin/nopowershell/releases) page. Bleeding edge code available in the [DEV](https://github.com/bitsadmin/nopowershell/tree/dev) branch. To kickstart your NoPowerShell skills, make sure to also check out the cmdlet [Cheatsheet](https://github.com/bitsadmin/nopowershell/blob/master/CHEATSHEET.md).

# Why NoPowerShell
NoPowerShell is developed to be used with the `execute-assembly` command of Cobalt Strike.
Reasons to use NoPowerShell:
- Executes pretty stealthy
- Powerful functionality
- Provides the cmdlets you are already familiar with in PowerShell, so no need to learn yet another tool
- If you are not yet very familiar with PowerShell, the cmd.exe aliases are available as well (i.e. `ping` instead of `Test-NetConnection`)
- In case via `powerpick` or `powershell` cmdlets are not available, they _are_ available in `nps` (i.e. cmdlets from the ActiveDirectory module)
- Easily extensible with only a few lines of C#

# Usage
## Examples
See [CHEATSHEET.md](https://github.com/bitsadmin/nopowershell/blob/master/CHEATSHEET.md).

## Install in Cobalt Strike
1. Copy both `NoPowerShell.exe` and `NoPowerShell.cna` to the **scripts** subfolder of Cobalt Strike
2. Launch Cobalt Strike and load the `NoPowerShell.cna` script in the Script Manager
3. Interact with a beacon and execute commands using the `nps` command

## Launch via rundll32
1. Create a new shortcut to `NoPowerShell.dll` file (drag using right click -> Create shortcuts here)
2. Update the shortcut prefixing the filename with `rundll32` and appending `,main`
3. The shortcut will now look like `rundll32 C:\Path\to\NoPowerShell.dll,main`
4. Double click the shortcut

## Note
When using NoPowerShell from cmd.exe or PowerShell, you need to escape the pipe character (`|`) with respectively a caret (`^`) or a backtick (`` ` ``), i.e.:

- cmd.exe: `ls ^| select Name`
- PowerShell: ```ls `| select Name```

# Known issues
- Pipeline characters need to surrounded by spaces
- TLS 1.1+ is not supported by .NET Framework 2, so any site enforcing it will result in a connection error

# Improvements
- Fix above issues
- Improve stability by adding exception handling
- Support for parameter groups
- Add support for ArrayArgument parameter
- Add support for .NET code in commandline, i.e.: `[System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent().Name`
