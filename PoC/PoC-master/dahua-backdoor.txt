Public rerelease of Dahua Backdoor PoC
https://github.com/mcw0/PoC/blob/master/dahua-backdoor-PoC.py

2017-03-20

With my newfound knowledge of vulnerable devices out there with an unbelievable number of more than 1 million Dahua / OEM units, where knowledge comes from a report made by NSFOCUS and my own research on shodan.io.

With this knowledge, I will not release the Python PoC to the public as before said of April 5, as it is not necessary when the PoC has already been verified by IPVM and other independent security researchers.

However, I'm open to share the PoC with serious security researchers if so desired, please e-mail me off list and be clear about who you are so I do not take you for a beggar, which I ignore.

I'm speechless, and almost don't know what I should write... I (hardly) can't believe what I have just found.

I have just discovered (to what I strongly believe is backdoor) in Dahua DVR/NVR/IPC and possible all their clones.

Since I am convinced this is a backdoor, I have my own policy to NOT notify the vendor before the community.
(I simply don't want to listen on their poor excuses, their tryings to keep me silent for informing the community)

In short:
You can delete/add/change name on the admin users, you change password on the admin users - this backdoor simply don't care about that!
It uses whatever names and passwords you configuring - by simply downloading the full user database and use your own credentials!

This is so simple as:
1. Remotely download the full user database with all credentials and permissions
2. Choose whatever admin user, copy the login names and password hashes
3. Use them as source to remotely login to the Dahua devices

This is like a damn Hollywood hack, click on one button and you are in...


Below PoC you will find here: https://github.com/mcw0/PoC/dahua-backdoor.py
Update:
Dahua has requested me to temporally remove the PoC code, will be back here again 5th April. (30 days)
/Sorry, bashis

Please have understanding of the quick hack of the PoC, I'm sure it could be done better.

Have a nice day
